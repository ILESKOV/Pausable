# Pausable
Pausable Contract
 
 We need Pausable contracts because BUGS happen, and when we find BUGS, we want to be able to upgrade our contract. And when it 
 happen we want to have setup to Upgrade
 
 But first of all, when we get information of the BUG we have a lot of things to do.
  - We have to find out what BUG is really about
  - We have to find a solution
  - And we have to make sure that our solution we implemented when we stressed out, and we really workung hard doesn't contain 
  more BUGS. We need to test our solution thoroughly to make sure that we doesn't have more BUGS in our contract.
  
  And all of that takes time. And in this time, when you know that u have BUG, someone could exploit it.
  So when you have bug u need to be able to Pause this contact as the owner. All functionality will block.
  
  Then we have time to make all of these steps to make sure to implement a good solution, then we can unPAUSE and 
  we ready to GO!!!
